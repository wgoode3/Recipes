## Ingredients

* 1 to 1½ lbs. chicken breast
* 12 corn tortillas
* 8 slices bacon
* 1 cup shredded jack cheese
* 10 oz cherry tomatoes quartered
* 8 romaine leaves shredded
* ¾ cup ranch dressing
* 1 chipotle chili (in adobo sauce)
* 1 14 oz can crushed tomatoes
* the zest of 1 lime
* the juices of 2 limes
* 1 tbsp cumin
* 1 tbsp paprika
* ½ tbsp cayenne
* salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

```
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
Combine cumin, paprika, cayenne, salt and pepper into a small bowl. 
Place chicken in dutch oven in a single layer and season with taco seasoning.
Cover with 1 can crushed tomatoes, lime zest and lime juice.
Add in 1 chipotle pepper minced, and about 1 tbsp of the adobo sauce as well.
Cook, covered, in oven for 90 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook slices of bacon and chop into bits.
Wash then slice cherry tomatoes into quarters.
Wash then slice romaine lettuce leaves into thin 1/4 inch strips (width-wise).
After about 90 minutes liquids will have mostly been absorbed and the chicken 
will readily shred when stirred.
Heat corn tortillas and assemble tacos with ranch dressing, bacon bits, chicken,
tomatoes, romaine lettuce, and shredded jack cheese.
Enjoy!
